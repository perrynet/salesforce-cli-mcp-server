For example, you can select by engine, such as the rules associated with the "retire-js" or "eslint" engine. Or select by the severity of the rules, such as high or moderate. You can also select rules using tag values or rule names. Every rule has a name, which is unique within the scope of an engine. Most rules have tags, although it\'s not required. An example of a tag is "Recommended". You can combine different criteria using colons to further filter the list; the colon works as an intersection. For example, `--rule-selector eslint:Security` runs rules associated only with the "eslint" engine that have the Security tag. The flag `--rule-selector eslint:Security:3` flag runs the "eslint" rules that have the Security tag and moderate severity (3). To add multiple rule selectors together (a union), specify the `--rule-selector` flag multiple times, such as `--rule-selector eslint:Recommended --rule-selector retire-js:3`.
